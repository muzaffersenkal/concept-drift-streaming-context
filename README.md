## About The Project

Numerous data-driven systems stream massive amounts of data at a high rate as a result of technological advancements. However, the data can change at any time, causing malfunctions and erroneous results. It is critical that these systems be able to adapt to these changes. The focus of this research is to investigate operating conditions in streaming contexts in presence of concept drift.
